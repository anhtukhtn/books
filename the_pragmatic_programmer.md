# The Pragmatic Programmer

## PREFACE
### What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?
 - **Early adopter/fast adapter**: instinct for technologies, love trying things out
 - **Inquisitive**: be a pack rat for little facts
 - **Critical thinker**: rarely take things as given without first getting the facts
 - **Realistic**: understand the underlying nature of each problem you face
 - **Jack of all trades**: try hard to be familiar with a board range of technologies and environments

 We're challenging you to THINK about WHAT you're DOING WHILE you're DOING 


## Chaper 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy

### 1. The Cat Ate My Source Code
One of the cornerstones of the pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking respnsibility for yourself and your actions.

#### Take Responsibility
You have the right NOT to take on a responsibility for an impossible situation, or one in which the risks are too great. When you DO accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. 
Make a mistake or an error in judgment -> admit it honestly and try to offer options.
Don't BLAME, or make up an excuse. Provide solutions.
If the disk crashes-taking all of your code with it-and you don't have a backup, it's YOUR FAULT.
"The cat ate my source code", won't cut it.
Before tell anyone why something can't be done, stop and listen to yourself first. Does it reasonable? or stupid?
Before you go and tell them the bad news, is there anything else you can try?
Instead of excuses, provide options. 
Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.
How to prevent it from happening again?
