# The Pragmatic Programmer

## PREFACE
### What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?
 - **Early adopter/fast adapter**: instinct for technologies, love trying things out
 - **Inquisitive**: be a pack rat for little facts
 - **Critical thinker**: rarely take things as given without first getting the facts
 - **Realistic**: understand the underlying nature of each problem you face
 - **Jack of all trades**: try hard to be familiar with a board range of technologies and environments

 We're challenging you to THINK about WHAT you're DOING WHILE you're DOING 


## Chaper 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy

### The Cat Ate My Source Code
One of the cornerstones of the pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking respnsibility for yourself and your actions.

#### Take Responsibility
You have the right NOT to take on a responsibility for an impossible situation, or one in which the risks are too great. When you DO accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held accountable for it. 

Make a mistake or an error in judgment -> admit it honestly and try to offer options.
Don't BLAME, or make up an excuse. Provide solutions.

If the disk crashes-taking all of your code with it-and you don't have a backup, it's YOUR FAULT.

"The cat ate my source code", won't cut it.
Before tell anyone why something can't be done, stop and listen to yourself first. Does it reasonable? or stupid?

Before you go and tell them the bad news, is there anything else you can try? Instead of excuses, provide options. 

Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.
How to prevent it from happening again? 

### Software Entropy

Don't live with Broken Windows. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered.

Take some action to prevent further damage and to show that you're on top of the situation.

### Good-Enough Software

You can discipline yourself to write software that's good enough-good enough for yours users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind.

#### Know when to stop

Dont' spoil a perfectly good program by overrembellishment and overrefinement. Move on, and let your code stand in its own right for a while.


## Chaper 6: While you are coding

Avoid programming by coincidence-replying on luck and accidental successes-in favor of programming deliberately

### Program by Coincidence

Doesn't know why the code is failing because didn't know why it worked in the first place.

#### Accidents of Implementation

It's easy to be fooled by this line of thought: "It works now, better leave well enough alone..."

#### Implicit Assumptions

It's easy to assume that X causes Y. DON'T ASSUME it, prove it.

#### How to Program Deliberately
- Always be aware of what you are doing
- Proceed from a plan, whether that plan is in your head, on the back of the cocktail napkin, or on a wall-sized
- Rely on reliable things
- Dont be a salve to history
