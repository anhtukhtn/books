# The Pragmatic Programmer

## PREFACE
### What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?
 - Early adopter/fast adapter: instinct for technologies, love trying things out
 - Inquisitive: be a pack rat for little facts
 - Critical thinker: rarely take things as given without first getting the facts
 - Realistic: understand the underlying nature of each problem you face
 - Jack of all trades: try hard to be familiar with a board range of technologies and environments

 We're challenging you to THINK about WHAT you're DOING WHILE you're DOING
